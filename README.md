A competition between scripting languages.

This is still work in progress and is not finished yet.

Languages that qualify
----------------------

Wikipedia defines a scripting language as "a programming language that
supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment
that can interpret (rather than compile) and automate the execution of
tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator."
([Wikipedia - Scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language))

For my purposes a scripting language is any language that has a program
that can run code supplied on standard input. It means that it's all about
the tools available and has nothing to do with the language itself.

Some examples:

2+2 Test
--------

```
$ echo 'print 2+2' | perl -l
4

$ echo 'print 2+2' | ruby -l
4

$ echo 'print 2+2' | python
4

$ echo 'console.log(2+2)' | node
4

$ echo '(prn (+ 2 2))' | clojure -
4
```

System requirements
-------------------

It will be written and tested on Ubuntu 14.04
but it should work on any standard Linux/Unix distribution. If it doesn't,
please [sumbit an issue](https://github.com/rsp/git-experiments/issues).
